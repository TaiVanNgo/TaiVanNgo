# üí´ About Me:

Hello, My name is Ngo Van Tai and I'm a 2nd year student at RMIT, majoring in Software Engineering. I am 20 years old and passionate about creating innovative software solutions. <br><br>Despite having less experience, I believe that with my young energy, ambition, laboriousness, and dedicated personality, I will try my best to leverage my academic background and job<br>experience.

## üéØ Projects:

- **[Arduino Remote-Controlled Car](https://github.com/TaiVanNgo/remote-controlled-car)**
  - Duration: Nov - 2024
  - Description: Designed and implemented a Bluetooth-controlled car using an Arduino board, the Dabble app, and an L298N motor driver. The car supports directional control (forward, backward, left, and right) through a gamepad interface and includes speed adjustment to correct motor drift. Integrated modular, easy-to-adapt code to enhance user experience and control precision. Demonstrated the project's functionality via a video demo and provided a comprehensive guide with hardware and software resources.

- **[Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/TaiVanNgo/Car-Price-Prediction)**
  - Duration: Sep - 2024
  - Description: Developed an AI-driven model for predicting car prices using a dataset of 19,000+ cars. Implemented comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and outlier removal. Tested multiple machine learning algorithms, with XGBoost yielding the best performance, achieving improved predictive accuracy.

- **[CTF writeups](https://github.com/TaiVanNgo/CTF-Write-up)**

  - Duration: 
  - Description: This my individual project serves as a comprehensive collection of detailed writeups from various Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions I've participated in. It showcases my problem-solving approach and accumulated knowledge in cybersecurity, covering diverse challenges across different domains. This repository is a reflection of my continuous learning and dedication to cybersecurity, designed to both document my progress and share insights with the broader infosec community.

- **[BuZzNet](https://github.com/lluciiiia/COSC2769_Full_Stack_Development_Group_Assignment)**

  - Duration: September - 2024
  - Description: This is my group assignment for the course COSC2769 - Full Stack Development. BuZzNet is the social media website application that helps people connect together.

- **Arduino Project**
  - Duration: May - 2024
  - Description: For our group assignment in the course EEET2505 - Introduction to Embedded Systems, we developed a system that transmits our first name in Morse code messages by detecting button presses. Using an Arduino Uno and various electrical components, we successfully implemented a method for Morse code transmission.
