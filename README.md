# üí´ About Me:

Hello, My name is Ngo Van Tai and I'm a 3rd year student at RMIT, majoring in Software Engineering. I am 21 years old and passionate about creating innovative software solutions. <br><br>Despite having less experience, I believe that with my young energy, ambition, laboriousness, and dedicated personality, I will try my best to leverage my academic background and job experience.

## üéØ Projects:

- **[Cashew Carbon Credits Platform](https://github.com/TaiVanNgo/yourSDGSolver)**
  - Duration: Jan - 2025
  - Description: As part of our solution for the 24-hour RMIT Hack-A-Venture 2024 hackathon, we developed a blockchain-based platform that empowers cashew farmers to earn income by selling carbon credits. The platform features farmer registration, carbon credit tracking, buyer offset purchases, and secure, verified transactions. Our innovative solution was recognized as the Champion of RMIT Hack-A-Venture 2024 for its impact and sustainability focus.

- **[NUC140 Clock Watch](https://github.com/TaiVanNgo/Clock-Watch-NUC140)**
  - Duration: Dec - 2024
  - Description: Built a digital stopwatch system on the NUC140 microcontroller with features like alarm setting, lap time recording, and precise time tracking. The project includes multiple modes (Idle, Alarm Set, Count, Pause, Check), modular FSM-based code, and accurate 1/10-second timing using Timer0 interrupts. A video demo and documentation provide an overview of the design, functionality, and implementation.
  
- **[Arduino Remote-Controlled Car](https://github.com/TaiVanNgo/remote-controlled-car)**
  - Duration: Nov - 2024
  - Description: Designed and implemented a Bluetooth-controlled car using an Arduino board, the Dabble app, and an L298N motor driver. The car supports directional control (forward, backward, left, and right) through a gamepad interface and includes speed adjustment to correct motor drift. Integrated modular, easy-to-adapt code to enhance user experience and control precision. Demonstrated the project's functionality via a video demo and provided a comprehensive guide with hardware and software resources.

- **[Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/TaiVanNgo/Car-Price-Prediction)**
  - Duration: Sep - 2024
  - Description: Developed an AI-driven model for predicting car prices using a dataset of 19,000+ cars. Implemented comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and outlier removal. Tested multiple machine learning algorithms, with XGBoost yielding the best performance, achieving improved predictive accuracy.

- **[CTF writeups](https://github.com/TaiVanNgo/CTF-Write-up)**

  - Duration: 
  - Description: This my individual project serves as a comprehensive collection of detailed writeups from various Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions I've participated in. It showcases my problem-solving approach and accumulated knowledge in cybersecurity, covering diverse challenges across different domains. This repository is a reflection of my continuous learning and dedication to cybersecurity, designed to both document my progress and share insights with the broader infosec community.

- **[BuZzNet](https://github.com/lluciiiia/COSC2769_Full_Stack_Development_Group_Assignment)**

  - Duration: September - 2024
  - Description: This is my group assignment for the course COSC2769 - Full Stack Development. BuZzNet is the social media website application that helps people connect together.

- **Arduino Project**
  - Duration: May - 2024
  - Description: For our group assignment in the course EEET2505 - Introduction to Embedded Systems, we developed a system that transmits our first name in Morse code messages by detecting button presses. Using an Arduino Uno and various electrical components, we successfully implemented a method for Morse code transmission.
